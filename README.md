# PONG GAME

Games are just a piece of software- an executable that people can double click and launch.Pong is a table tennis inspired game, and is considered one of the Classic in gaming industry. There has been many iterations of this game from very nostalgic to a very modern look. This is one of its iteration written in C++ programming language using <windows.h> library with the help of the UNICODE. It doesnâ€™t use any graphics so all the drawings are drawn with characters.

_WIKIPEDIA : Unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems._

_NOTE: This program might not run on other platforms apart from WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM (PLATFORM DEPENDENT). This program was made on Visual Studio Community, so it is preferred to be compiled on Visual Studio Community which UNICODE on settings._

This game has very same aesthetic and playing feel as its predecessors and uses one puck and 2 paddles controlled by each of the PLAYERS. Keeping the keys pressed slide the paddles either UP or DOWN to defend from being scored points. Puck moves in all direction and gets deflected when collided with a Paddle surface.
